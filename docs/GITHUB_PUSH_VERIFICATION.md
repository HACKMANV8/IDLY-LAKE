## What to Expect After the Fix

### Before (❌ Broken)
Your GitHub repository had files like:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```
With random content like "rollup", "webpack", etc.

### After (✅ Fixed)
Your GitHub repository should now have:
```
📁 src/
   📄 App.jsx
   📄 main.jsx
📁 public/
   📄 vite.svg
📄 index.html
📄 package.json
📄 vite.config.js
📄 .gitignore
...and other proper files
```

Each file contains the **actual content** from your WebGenie project.

## Step-by-Step to Verify

1. **Generate a project** in WebGenie
   - Use the chat to create a simple React app or webpage
   
2. **Click the GitHub icon button** (next to download)
   
3. **Fill in the dialog**:
   - Repository Name: `my-test-project`
   - GitHub Token: `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`
   
4. **Wait for success message**
   - Should say "✅ Success! Your project has been pushed to GitHub!"
   
5. **Visit GitHub**
   - Go to: `https://github.com/Prish399/my-test-project`
   - You should see proper files with real content
   
6. **Verify files**
   - Click on `src/App.jsx` 
   - Should see React code (not "rollup" or random text)
   - Click on `package.json`
   - Should see project configuration

## Quick Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Still see numeric files (0, 1, 2) | Files are not being fetched properly - check browser console |
| Files exist but are empty | Content parsing issue - check API logs |
| "No files found" error | Sandbox might not be active - create a new project first |
| GitHub authentication fails | Token expired - create new one at github.com/settings/tokens |
